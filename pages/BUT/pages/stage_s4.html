                                    During my internship, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Enguerrand Boitel,
                                     a PhD student at the University of Portsmouth in England. The focus of our project 
                                     was on emotion recognition, specifically developing models for 
                                     various modalities including videos, text, audio, and images.
                                    <br><br>

                                    My primary responsibility revolved around improving the existing deBERTa model, 
                                    as well as fine-tuning an OpenAI model to achieve similar results for comparative 
                                    analysis. Additionally, I played a key role in implementing the wandb tool to enhance the functionality of our models.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Furthermore, I contributed to the development of a live transcription tool 
                                    for real-time applications that leveraged our emotion recognition models. 
                                    Through these endeavors, our aim was to advance the field of emotion recognition
                                     and contribute to the broader understanding of human emotions across different modalities.

                                <span class="label-large card-subtitle">
                                    During the internship, my main focus was on developing and improving emotion recognition models using different 
                                    modalities, particularly text. I worked on training and evaluating models, comparing their performance, 
                                    and fine-tuning them to achieve better results.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Jupyter Notebooks served as the primary tool for documenting and 
                                    organizing the code. They provided a user-friendly interface and excellent support
                                     for data analysis and machine learning tasks, making them well-suited for implementing the project's objectives.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Collaboration among team members was facilitated through a shared drive, where datasets
                                     and trained models were stored. This allowed for seamless collaboration and knowledge sharing.
                                    <br><br>

                                    <br>

                                    Throughout the internship, I worked on various tasks related to emotion recognition. 
                                    This included creating and training a deBERTa model specifically designed for sentiment analysis. 
                                    I also fine-tuned a Davinci model from OpenAI for the same purpose. 
                                    Additionally, I utilized the wandb tool to compare different models and their hyperparameters.
                                    <br><br>

                                    <br>

                                    Evaluation and comparative studies were conducted using different datasets, 
                                    including the BAUM dataset and additional datasets sourced from Kaggle. 
                                    The performance of the developed models was assessed using these datasets.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Furthermore, I contributed to the development of a combined model that leveraged the strengths of the trained models to detect emotions in videos and live streams.
                                    <br><br>

                                    Overall, my work during the internship involved advancing the field of emotion recognition 
                                    by developing, fine-tuning, and evaluating models for various modalities, with a specific focus on text analysis.

                                     In my project, I worked extensively with datasets for training and evaluating 
                                     the emotion recognition models. This included managing the data, performing 
                                     necessary preprocessing tasks, and ensuring proper storage and organization. 
                                     Additionally, I actively contributed to managing information data by
